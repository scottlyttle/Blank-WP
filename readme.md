# Yet Another Base Theme for WordPress (YABTFW)

A base HTML5 and SCSS theme for WordPress, with all the trimmings, but none of the fat.

**Note:** YABTFW requires you to have the [Susy gem installed](http://susy.oddbird.net/guides/getting-started/)

### Features of YABTFW

- HTML5 code base
- Responsive base including [Susy](http://susy.oddbird.net/)
- Includes [Modernizer](http://modernizr.com/) for feature detection and cross-browser compatibility (development version)
- Includes respond.js for IE8 media queries
- Wigetized and custom menu ready
- Pre-configured for Compass with config.rb (including moving style.css to template root once processed)
- Custom comments layout (through functions.php) and custom comment form (found in inc/respond.php)
- Post thumbnails and post format enabled
- [Normalize](http://necolas.github.com/normalize.css) CSS reset included (slightly customised)
- Scripts enqueued through functions.php
- Latest jQuery (enqueued the right way)
- _wordpress.scss file for targeting WordPress generated elements
- Asynchronous Google Analytics script in place (just edit the ID)
- Not much else.

To personalise the theme you should only need to do a find & replace for the term 'yabtfw' and replace with your own theme name (in the functions)
